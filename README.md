# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Overview:
The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports to prove it!
Write a code that will create a table dynamically based upon the dataset provided. 

## Objective:
1. Created a basic custom HTML web page.<br>
2. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.<br>
3. Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote a JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.<br>
4. Wrote a JavaScript code to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
* date/time
* city
* state
* country
* shape
